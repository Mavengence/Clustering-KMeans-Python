## Abstract
As part of my assignment, I programmed the K-Means clustering by myself to have a better understanding about that and to visualize it properly.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, to get our Notebooks, Presentation and Project Report.

```
git clone https://github.com/Mavengence/Clustering-KMeans-Python-IS4861-Assignment.git
```

### Prerequisites

- Of course you need git to get the source
- If you want to compile the report or the presentation by ur self u need a LaTex Compiler for your OS and maybe an IDE which makes things easier
- If you want to compile, train and play with our Code you need a python working environment. We used Jupyter Notebooks. The requiered packeges you can see in the Notebooks itself.

### Run the Notebook

```
cd/you_cloned_repo_location jupyter notebook
```

### Deployment

Just pull the repo, if you wanna change sth you can ask :)
